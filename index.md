pitch: The Developer Guide allows businesses, developers, designers
       and solution architects to produce secure web applications.
       If done from the earliest stages, secure
       applications cost about the same to develop as insecure applications,
       but are far more cost effective in the long run.

## OWASP Developer Guide
Along with the OWASP Top Ten, the Developer Guide is one of the original resources
published by OWASP soon after it was created in 2001.

Version 1.0 of the Developer Guide was provided in 2002
and since then there have been various [releases][versions],
the latest being version 2.0 in 2005.

The Developer Guide needs to be updated for the modern security landscape,
and OWASP is reviving this project to do just that.
The project has a team of leaders that will oversee the project
and now we need as many members of the security community as possible to contribute.
