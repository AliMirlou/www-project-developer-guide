## Contribute to the Developer Guide

The Developer Guide is first and foremost a guide for development teams,
and is intended to be a body of knowledge that these teams can draw on and should be familiar with.
The Developer Guide must be a community effort with a diverse and wide range of contributors
from across the whole software security field.
The Developer Guide does not seek to replicate the various projects and resources already available,
such as OWASP ASVS or WSTG, but provides basic and medium level introductions to software security;
referencing other projects for a more in depth or advanced treatment of the subjects.

There are various areas of the guide that have not been started and these need content.
There are other areas of the guide that have some content which need editing or revising.
Listed below are the sections and a snapshot of their status; please contribute where you can.
