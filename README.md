## OWASP Foundation Developer Guide project 

This repo is the source for the OWASP Developer Guide project [web pages][pages]
and the [developer guide][guide] itself

## Developer Guide
This guide is one of the original documents from OWASP and so has a long history.
The DevGuide repository has many of the [previous versions][versions]
going back to the [original version 1.0][original] from 2002.
Note that the [DevGuide repository][DevGuide] has been deprecated in favour of this one.

The latest developer guide source code is in markdown and can be found under
the ['current_release'][guide] directory.
This is being actively worked on for the next release of the Developer Guide
and may be subject to large scale changes.
