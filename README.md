## OWASP Foundation Developer Guide project 

This repo is the source for the OWASP Developer Guide project [web pages][pages]
and also the [developer guide][draft] itself

## Developer Guide
This guide is one of the original documents from OWASP and so has a long history.
The [DevGuide repository][DevGuide] has many of the [previous versions][versions]
going back to the [original version 1.0][original] from 2002.
Note that the original DevGuide [repository][DevGuide] has been deprecated in favour of this one.

The source code for the latest draft developer guide and can be found under the ['draft'][draft] directory.
The source is in markdown and will be used to create PDF, ePub and web outputs, although this is not in place yet.
This is being actively worked on for the next release of the Developer Guide and may be subject to large scale changes.
