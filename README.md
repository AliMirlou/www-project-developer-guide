## OWASP Foundation Developer Guide project

This repo is the source for the OWASP Developer Guide project [web pages][pages]
and also the [developer guide][draftGuide] itself

## Developer Guide

This guide is one of the original documents from OWASP and so has a long history.
The [DevGuide repository][devGuide] has many of the [previous versions][versions]
going back to the [original version 1.0][original] from 2002.
Note that the original DevGuide [repository][DevGuide] has been deprecated in favour of this one.

The source code for the latest draft developer guide can be found under the ['draft'][draft] directory.
The source is in markdown and is used to create the [developer guide][draft] HTML, PDF and ePub outputs.
The content is subject to large scale changes with no notice,
as it is being actively worked on for the next release of the Developer Guide.
