### 11.1 Security gap analysis guides

Security gap analysis and security gap evaluation are central to Governance, Risk & Compliance activities
and are used to gain and maintain certification to a management system standard
such as [ISO 27001][iso27001] 'Information security, cybersecurity and privacy protection'.

Guidance is important for these analysis and evaluation activities, with the OWASP projects [SAMM][samm],
[MASVS][masvs] and [ASVS][asvs] providing this information and advice.

Sections:

11.1.1 [Software Assurance Maturity Model](01-samm.md)  
11.1.2 [Application Security Verification Standard](02-asvs.md)  
11.1.3 [Mobile Application Security](03-mas.md)
