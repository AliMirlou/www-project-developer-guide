### 7.2 WebGoat

The OWASP [WebGoat][webgoat] project is a deliberately insecure web application that can be
used to attack common application vulnerabilities in a safe environment.
It can also be used to exercise application security tools, such as OWASP ZAP, to practice
scanning and identifying the various vulnerabilities built into WebGoat.

WebGoat is a well established OWASP project and achieved Lab Project status many years ago.

#### What is WebGoat?

To Do: go into more detail about WebGoat and WebWolf so that a developer
can gain an overview of what this training tool can provide for them.

#### Why use WebGoat?

WebGoat is one of those tools that has many uses; certainly during training but also when presenting demonstrations,
testing out security tools and so on.
Where ever you need a deliberately vulnerable web application running in a self contained and safe environment then
WebGoat should be one of the first to consider.

Reasons to use WebGoat, and there will be more:

* Practical learning how to exploit web applications
* Ready made target during talks and demonstration on penetration testing
* Evaluating dynamic application security testing (DAST) tools; they should identify the known vulnerabilities
* Practising penetration testing skills

#### How to use WebGoat

To Do: give a brief outline of how to run WebGoat.
Do not repeat the project documentation itself; ideally provide a primer and a pointer to the documentation.

#### How to use WebWolf
