### 5.1 Introduction to security requirements

This section deals with Security Requirements, which is a security practice in the Design business function
section of the OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model ([SAMM][samm]).
Security requirements practice has two activities, Software Requirements and Supplier Security.

#### Overview

Security requirements are part of every secure development process
and form the foundation for the application's security posture.
Requirements can come from many sources, and in general there are two main sources:

1. Software-related requirements which specify objectives and expectations
    to protect the service and data at the core of the application
2. Requirements relative to supplier organizations that are part of the development context of the application

The security requirements should be identified and recorded at the beginning of a new development
and also at the beginning of new features to an existing application.
These security requirements should be periodically revisited and revised as necessary;
for example security standards are updated and new standards come into force,
and this may have a direct impact on the application.
