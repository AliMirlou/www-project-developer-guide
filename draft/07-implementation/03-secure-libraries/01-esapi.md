### 5.3.1 Enterprise Security API library

The OWASP Enterprise Security API (ESAPI) library is a free, open source, web application security control library
that makes it easier for Java programmers to write lower-risk applications.
The ESAPI Java library is designed to make it easier for programmers to retrofit security into existing Java applications,
and also serve as a solid foundation for new development.

The [ESAPI library][esapi] is an OWASP Lab project that is under active development for [Java][esapi-java] only.

#### What is the ESAPI library?

To Do: go into more detail about the ESAPI library so that a developer
can gain an overview of what this Java library can provide for them.

#### Why use it?

To Do: provide more context for the ESAPI Java library that allows developers to determine
whether to use it in their project.

#### How to use it

To Do: give a brief outline of how applying the ESAPI library provides valuable application security for a development team.
Do not repeat the project documentation itself; ideally provide a primer and a pointer to the documentation.
