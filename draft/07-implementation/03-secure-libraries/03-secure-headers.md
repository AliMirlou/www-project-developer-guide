### 5.3.3 OWASP Secure Headers Project

The [OWASP Secure Headers Project][oshp] (also called OSHP) describes HTTP response headers
that your application can use to increase the security of your application.
Once set, these HTTP response headers can restrict modern browsers from running into easily preventable vulnerabilities.
The OWASP Secure Headers Project intends to raise awareness and use of these headers.

OSHP is an OWASP Lab Project site contains guidance and downloads on:

* Response Headers
* Browser Support
* Best Practices
* Technical Resources
* Code Snippets

#### What is OSHP?

To Do: go into more detail about OSHP so that a developer / penetration tester
can gain an overview of how this can provide an HTTP security header configuration.

#### Why use it?

To Do: provide more context for OSHP that allows developers to determine whether to use it.

#### How to use it

To Do: give a brief outline of how OSHP provides value for a development team.
Do not repeat the project documentation itself; ideally provide a primer and a pointer to the documentation.
