### 5.2.2 Dependency-Track

To Do: supply a couple of sentences on the OWASP Dependency-Track component analysis platform tool
and its ability to analyse a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM),
including its status as an OWASP project and where to find it.

#### What is Dependency-Track?

To Do: go into more detail about the Dependency-Track tool so that a developer
can gain an overview of what this tool can provide for them.

#### Why use it?

To Do: provide more context for the Dependency-Track tool and SBOMs that allows developers to determine
whether to use them in their project.

#### How to use it

The OWASP Spotlight series provides an overview of tracking dependencies and inspecting SBOMs using Dependency-Track:
'Project 15 - [OWASP Dependency Track][spotlight15]'.

To Do: give a brief outline of how applying the Dependency-Track tool provides value for a web development team.
Do not repeat the project documentation itself; ideally provide a primer and a pointer to the documentation.
