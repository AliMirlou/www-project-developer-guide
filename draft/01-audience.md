### 1. Audience

The OWASP Developer Guide has been written by the security community to help software developers write solid,
safe and secure applications.
Generally it describes the security practices within the Design and Implementation business functions
of the OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model ([SAMM][samm]).
Application developers should try to be familiar with the entire guide;
it is far harder to write solid applications than to destroy them.

The content of the main sections is aimed at an introductory level,
with more advanced detail contained in the sub-sections.
This guide does not seek to replicate the many excellent sources on specific security topics;
it will rarely deal with a subject at an advanced level and instead provides links for specialist security topics.
