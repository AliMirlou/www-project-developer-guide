### 1. Audience

The OWASP Developer Guide has been written by the security community to help software developers write solid,
safe and secure applications.
Generally it describes the security practices within the Design and Implementation business functions
of the OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model ([SAMM][samm]).

There is a great deal of information contained in this guide but it has been kept to a reasonable length;
there will never be a one page version of this guide.
The main sections of this guide contain the reasoning behind choosing certain concepts, and further details are provided in the sub-sections.
Keeping the Developer Guide concise allows more architects, designers, business analysts,
software engineers and developers to be able to digest the contents, thus creating safe and more secure applications.

The content of the main sections is aimed at an introductory level, with more advanced detail contained in the sub-sections.
This guide does not seek to replicate the many excellent sources on specific security topics;
it will rarely deal with a subject at an advanced level and instead provides links for specialist security topics.

Software developers should read the entire Guide: it is far harder to write solid applications than to destroy them.
Software developers work in many domains - web, embedded, APIs, mobile, cloud, desktop and so on -
all of these require reasonable depth of knowledge to ensure good security.

Architects and designers should digest the main sections and use the remaining sub-sections like an encyclopedia or dictionary,
looking up concepts as necessary.

Those who set policy are recommended to read as much as they can;
only by knowledge of what can go wrong can organizations set policy to prevent the acquisition or development of insecure software.
