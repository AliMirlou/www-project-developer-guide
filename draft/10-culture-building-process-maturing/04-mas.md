### 8.4 Mobile Application Security

To Do: supply a couple of sentences on the Mobile Application Security (MAS) project, such as its status as an OWASP project,
where to find it along with the two components Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS)
and Mobile Application Security Testing Guide (MASTG).

#### What is MAS?

To Do: go into more detail about MASVS (but not necessarily MASTG) so that the developer gains an overview
of what it provides specifically for their culture building and process maturing.

#### Why use it?

To Do: provide more context for around the MAS project to allow developers
to determine whether to use it in their requirements process.

#### How to use it

To Do: give a brief outline of how MASVS (and maybe MASTG) can be used by the development teams
for their culture building and process maturing.
Do not repeat the MAS project documentation itself; ideally provide a primer and a pointer to the documentation.
