### 8.2 Software Assurance Maturity Model

To Do: supply a couple of sentences on the Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) project,
including its status as an OWASP project and where to find it.

#### What is SAMM?

To Do: go into more detail about the SAMM project so that a developer can gain an overview of what it can provide
for their culture building and process maturing activities.

#### Why use it?

To Do: provide more context for the SAMM model that allows developers
to determine whether to use it in their culture building and process maturing activities.

#### How to use it

The OWASP Spotlight series provides an overview of using the SAMM to guide development:
'Project 9 - [Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)][spotlight09]'.

To Do: give a brief outline of how SAMM can be used by the development teams for their culture building and process maturing.
Do not repeat the project documentation itself; ideally provide a primer and a pointer to the documentation.
