There are various 'Top 10' projects in OWASP that, depending on the context, may be referred to as the 'OWASP Top 10'.
Here is a list of the stable 'Top 10' projects:

* [API Security Top 10][api10]
* [Data Security Top 10][data10]
* [Low-Code/No-Code Top 10][lcnc10]

There are other OWASP Top 10s that are still being worked on as 'incubator' projects, so this list may be revised.
