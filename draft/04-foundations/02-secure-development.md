### 4.2 Secure development and integration

Secure development is described by the OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model [(SAMM)][samm]
in the Design, Implementation and Verification business functions.

#### Overview

Software development can be done in many different ways, and the process of application development
has various established methodologies. This can be a traditional waterfall approach,
alternatively it could follow the Agile Manifesto or it could be continuous integration and delivery,
spiral development or any variants of these.
Which development process is used depends on the best fit for the organization and development teams involved.

Common to all these different approaches to application development is the need to incorporate security practices
into the process, ideally building security into every activity within the process.
