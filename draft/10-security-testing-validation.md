### 10. Security Testing and Validation

The OWASP Development Guide is being rewritten by the OWASP community.
and the content of this section has yet to be filled in.

If you would like to contribute then follow the 
[contributing guidelines](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-developer-guide/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
and submit your content for review.

The following subsections are planned:

  * Security test cases
  * SAST
  * DAST (hive off to OWASP ASVS and OWASP WSTG)
