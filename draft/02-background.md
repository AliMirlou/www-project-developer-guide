### 2. Background

Welcome to the OWASP Development Guide.

Along with the OWASP Top Ten, the Developer Guide is one of the original resources
published soon after OWASP was formed in 2001.
Version 1.0 of the Developer Guide was released in 2002
and since then there have been various [releases][versions] culminating in version 2.0 in 2005.
The guide has been revised extensively to bring it up to date since then and no longer has version numbers,
but notionally it is version 4.0 as version 3.0 was never released.

The purpose of this guide is to provide an introduction to security
and a handy reference for application / system developers.
Much of this guide is based on various OWASP sources:

* [Top 10][top10]
* [Top 10 Proactive Controls][proactive]
* [Application Security Verification Standard ((ASVS)][asvs]
* [Cheat Sheet Series][cheat]
* [Integration Standards project][ois]
* [Mobile Application Security][mas]
* [Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)][samm]
* [Web Security Testing Guide][wstg]

These resources provide greater detail and wider context for the various sections in this guide.
