## 3. Requirements

Referring to the OWASP [Top Ten Proactive Controls][control1], security requirements are statements of
security functionality that ensure the different security properties of a software application are being satisfied.
Security requirements are derived from industry standards, applicable laws, and a history of past vulnerabilities.
Security requirements define new features or additions to existing features to solve a specific security problem
or eliminate potential vulnerabilities.

Security requirements also provide a foundation of vetted security functionality for an application.
Instead of creating a custom approach to security for every application,
standard security requirements allow developers to reuse the definition of security controls and best practices;
those same vetted security requirements provide solutions for security issues that have occurred in the past.

So you can look at it this way: requirements exist to prevent the repeat of past security failures.
