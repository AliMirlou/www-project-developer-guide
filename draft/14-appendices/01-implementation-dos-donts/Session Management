Session Management
Here is a collection of Do's and Don'ts when it comes to session management, gathered from practical experiences.

Creation of session
Session identifier creation must always be done on a trusted system (e.g., The server)

Creation of session
If a session was established before login, close that session and establish a new session after a successful login

Creation of session
Generate a new session identifier on any re-authentication

Random number generation
Session management controls should use well vetted algorithms that ensure sufficiently random session identifiers. Rely on CSPRNG rather than PRNG for random number generation

Domain and path
Set the domain and path for cookies containing authenticated session identifiers to an appropriately restricted value for the site

Logout
Logout functionality should fully terminate the associated session or connection

Session timeout
Establish a session inactivity timeout that is as short as possible, based on balancing risk and business functional requirements. In most cases it should be no more than several hours

Session ID
Do not expose session identifiers in URLs, error messages or logs. Session identifiers should only be located in the HTTP cookie header. For example, do not pass session identifiers as GET parameters

Session ID
Supplement standard session management for sensitive server-side operations, like account management, by utilising per-session strong random tokens or parameters. This method can be used to prevent Cross Site Request Forgery attacks
