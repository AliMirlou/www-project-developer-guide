### 6.1.2 Mobile Application Security

To Do: supply a couple of sentences on the Mobile Application Security (MAS) project,
including its status as an OWASP project, where to find it,
along with the two components Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS)
and Mobile Application Security Testing Guide (MASTG).

#### What is MAS?

To Do: go into more detail about MASTG (but not necessarily MASVS) so that the developer gains an overview
of what it provides for them specifically from a verification point of view.

#### Why use it?

To Do: provide more context for around the MAS project to allow developers
to determine whether to use it in their verification process.

#### How to use it

To Do: give a brief outline of how MASTG (and maybe MASVS) can be used for the development teams and the verification.
Do not repeat the MAS project documentation itself; ideally provide a primer and a pointer to the documentation.
