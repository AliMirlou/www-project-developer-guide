### 6.2.1 Zed Attack Proxy

The Zed Attack Proxy ([ZAP][zap]) verification and testing project is a widely used
dynamic application security testing tool used for web applications and proxies.

ZAP was for a long time an OWASP Flagship project and is now a project within
the Software Security Project ([SSP][ssp]) organization, which itself is part of the Linux Foundation.
Installers for various platforms can be [downloaded][zapdownload] from the ZAP website.
