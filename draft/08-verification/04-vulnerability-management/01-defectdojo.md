### 6.4.1 DefectDojo

OWASP [DefectDojo][defectdojo] is a DevSecOps tool for vulnerability management.
It provides one platform to orchestrate end-to-end security testing, vulnerability tracking,
deduplication, remediation, and reporting.

DefectDojo is an OWASP [Flagship project][defectdojo-project] and is well established;
the project was established in 2013 and has been in continuous development / release since then.

#### What is DefectDojo?

[DefectDojo][defectdojo] is an open source vulnerability management tool that streamlines the testing process
by integration of templating, report generation, metrics, and baseline self-service tools.

DefectDojo streamlines the testing process through several ‘models’ that an admin can manipulate with Python code.
The core models include: ‘engagements’, ‘tests’ and ‘findings’.
DefectDojo has supplemental models that facilitate metrics, authentication, report generation, and tools.

#### Why use it?

DefectDojo integrates with many open-source and proprietary/commercial [tools][defectdojo-tools] from various domains:

* Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
* Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
* Software Composition Analysis (SCA) / SBOM
* Scanning of infrastructure, API and others

It also integrates with the [Threagile Threat Modeling][threagile] tool,
and probably with more threat modeling tools in the future.

#### How to use it

Testing or installing DefectDojo is straight forward using the [installation instructions][defectdojo-install].
An instance of DefectDojo can be setup via a script that handles all dependencies,
configures the database, and creates a super user.
The DefectDojo [documentation][defectdojo-docs] provides all the information on setting up, usage and integrations.
