### Contributing
The Developer Guide needs to be updated for the modern security landscape,
and OWASP is reviving this project to do just that.
The project has a team of leaders that will oversee the project
and now we need as many members of the security community as possible to contribute.

All contributions and suggestions are certainly welcome, we only ask that
you follow the [contributing code of conduct][conduct].
Contributors can [make suggestions][issues] and provide changes via a [pull request][request].

Feel free to discuss topics in the [project wiki][wiki] and create new discussions.

### Etiquette
There is a [project board][dashboard] which helps to coordinate contributions.

* select an issue from the project board for the section you want to work on
* if this issue is free ask for it to be assigned to you
* if the issue has already been assigned then coordinate with the existing owner
* if there is not an existing issue that describes your content then [suggest one][issues]
* provide your contributed content as a [pull request][request]

### Style Guide
The Developer Guide will have many contributors, and it is an aim to keep the style of writing similar throughout.
It would be good to keep to a style used in OWASP flagship projects [ASVS][asvs] and [WSTG][wstg],
which is speaking from first person plural and semi-formal in tone.

### Technical level
Generally the guide is aimed at the introductory to medium technical levels,
and should rarely deal with a subject at an advanced level.
This is a deliberate policy that makes the guide as accessible as possible and keeps the length reasonable.

The content of the main sections should be aimed at the introductory level,
with more detail contained in the sub-sections at a medium technical level.
Note this guide does should not replicate the many detailed sources on specific security topics;
instead provide links to specialist security topics.
