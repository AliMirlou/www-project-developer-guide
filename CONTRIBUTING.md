### Contributing
The Developer Guide needs to be updated for the modern security landscape,
and OWASP is reviving this project to do just that.
The project has a team of leaders that will oversee the project
and now we need as many members of the security community as possible to contribute.

All contributions and suggestions are certainly welcome, we only ask that
you follow the [contributing code of conduct][conduct].
Contributors can [make suggestions][issues] and provide changes via a [pull request][request].

Feel free to discuss topics in the [project wiki][wiki] and create new discussions.

### Etiquette
There is a [project board][dashboard] which helps to coordinate contributions.

* select an issue from the project board for the section you want to work on
* if this issue is free ask for it to be assigned to you
* if the issue has already been assigned then coordinate with the existing owner
* if there is not an existing issue that describes your content then [suggest one][issues]
* provide your contributed content as a [pull request][request]
